# Î²ound
Stack-based interpreted esolang involving integers and single char commands. Inspired by Stuck.  
I'm working on this often, sometimes adding/changing the behavior of commands. Once I reach a point I am happy with, v1.0 will be released.  
  
## Usage
`python bound.py`  
`python bound.py [commands]`  
  
## Command List

| Command | Function                                                                     | Example                               |
